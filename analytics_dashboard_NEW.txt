This is the continuation after line 506. I'll append this manually with PowerShell commands since the file is too complex for replacement tools.

The analytics dashboard needs:
1. Top patterns table section (Excel style table)
2. System health cards section (two column grid)
3. Recent feedback table section
4. Chart.js script section
5. Close all divs

Due to the complexity and length (869 lines), it's better to continue working with this file in smaller focused sections or let me rebuild it completely.
